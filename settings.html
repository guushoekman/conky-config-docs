            top of what Conky draws. Conky puts 'conky_' in front

            such as freeing memory which has been allocated by

        Desktop windows are special windows that have no window
        decorations; are always visible on your desktop; do not
        appear in your pager or taskbar; and are sticky across all
        workspaces. Panel windows reserve space along a desktop
        edge, just like panels and taskbars, preventing maximized
        windows from overlapping them. The edge is chosen based on
        the alignment option. Override windows are not under the
        control of the window manager. Hints are ignored. This type
        of window can be useful for certain situations.

          following the command are optional. Gradient colors can
          be specified as hexadecimal values with no 0x or #
          prefix. Use the -t switch to enable a temperature
          gradient, so that small values are "cold" with color 1
          and large values are "hot" with color 2. Without the -t
          switch, the colors produce a horizontal gradient
          spanning the width of the graph. The scale parameter
          defines the maximum value of the graph. Use the -l
          switch to enable a logarithmic scale, which helps to see
          small values. The default size for graphs can be
          controlled via the default_graph_height and

          x,y position will move the position of the image, and
          changing the WxH will scale the image. If you specify the
          no-cache flag (-n), the image will not be cached.
          Alternately, you can specify the -f int switch to specify a
          cache flush interval for a particular image. Example:
          ${image /home/brenden/cheeseburger.jpg -p 20,20 -s 200x200}
          will render 'cheeseburger.jpg' at (20,20) scaled to 200x200
          pixels. Conky does not make any attempt to adjust the
          position (or any other formatting) of images, they are just
          rendered as per the arguments passed. The only reason
          $image is part of the conky.text section, is to allow for runtime
          modifications, through $execp $lua_parse, or some other
          method.

              <p>The connection index provides you with access to
              each connection in the port monitor. The monitor will
              return information for index values from 0 to n-1
              connections. Values higher than n-1 are simply ignored.
              For the "count" item, the connection index must be
              omitted. It is required for all other items.</p>

                      Displays the remote host name of the
                      first connection on a privileged port
                  </li>
  <li>
                      <strong>${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport

                  </li>
  </ul>
              <p>Note that port monitor variables which share the
              same port range actually refer to the same monitor, so
              many references to a single port range for different
              items and different indexes all use the same monitor
              internally. In other words, the program avoids creating
              redundant monitors.</p>

# Conky configuration documentation
I love Conky but got a bit frustrated by the [configuration variables table](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Configuration-Variables#configuration-variables) on the Github repo. The table isn't properly visible because it's too wide for the div it's in.

This is nothing more than full screen versions of the configuration variables and settings tables.

I'm in no way connected to Conky. I made this for personal use but figured others might find it useful too.
